The main.py file contains the heart of the project. Here the whole text adventure game is written with branching paths. It imports multiple functions from packages
I've made as well as premade ones. From the packages I've created typing "random" at the beginging of the game will allow the player to have all details, that can be random, 
be randomize for them. Conversly, the player can type "custom" to create their own character with details of their own that would otherwise be random. All the player has
to do from here is to read and type in the matching choice they want. I made it so you can only type in the numbered options available. Additionally, anytime the player
is prompted to type a choice, the player can instead type "player" to see all current stats about their character. The format returned was structured from the class package
I made.
